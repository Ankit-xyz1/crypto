A lightweight crypto wallet app that enables users to generate and manage wallets on the **Solana blockchain**. Ideal for dApps, projects, or developers who need quick and secure wallet creation on Solana.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 Create new Solana wallets (Keypair generation)
- 📁 Export and save wallet details (public/private key)
- 🧾 Display wallet address and balance
- 🪙 Ready for integration with Solana dApps
- 🛡️ Follows best practices for key management

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Solana Web3.js** – Blockchain interaction
- **TypeScript / JavaScript** – App logic
- **React / Next.js** *(optional)* – Frontend (if applicable)
- **TailwindCSS** *(optional)* – Styling

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/solana-wallet-creator](https://github.com/Ankit-xyz1/crypto).git
cd solana-wallet-creator
npm install
npm run dev
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

const wallet = Keypair.generate();
console.log("Public Key:", wallet.publicKey.toBase58());
console.log("Secret Key:", wallet.secretKey);
```
